## About Me

...and this website too

</hgroup>

I'm **Jordan**, known online (almost everywhere) as **Drowrin**.
This is my hobby site.

I've been passionate about software engineering since before I knew that term.
It's one of my oldest interests, which I was fortunate enough to turn into a
career. This site will contain a lot of thoughts about that, including how this
site was made!

I also like to give my detailed thoughts on games, movies, books,
podcasts--whatever entertainment I've experienced that gave me strong thoughts.
Every year I round them up in a big ranked list that I spend way too much time
on.

I'm very opinionated about Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TTRPGs), and I use this
place to dump those thoughts. I'm always excited to try new games and explore
new styles of play. I run live Actual Play podcasts--usually several per
week--in a variety of systems.

**TL;DR** -- _I'm a huge nerd_
